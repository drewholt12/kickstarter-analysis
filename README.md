# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Louise requires information to identify factors that may influence a campaign to a successful outcome.  Her theater production, "Fever", is seeking $10K financing.  Analyzing Kickstarter campaign data, to identify trends and factors that influence campaign outcomes.  Findings will be presented visually using charts and graphs.  Visualizations contribute to identifying trends or links within a set of data.  Louise will have information tailored to the needs of the specific campaign.
   
### Purpose
	  
## Analysis and Challenges
A Kickstarter data set containing over 4000 campaigns was utilized for this project.   The various categories within this data set were filtered to “theater” fundraising campaigns from 2009 through 2017.  All outcomes were considered to provide the best detailed report.  The final data set includes 1369 campaigns.  Main analysis visualizations are “Outcomes Based on Launch Date” and “Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals”.  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

This chart shows all theater campaigns.  The campaigns are segregated by the month of the year they began and three outcomes- successful, failed, and canceled.  The chart incorporates all types of theater, all years represented in the data set, and all countries of origin.  Note that none were canceled in the month of October in this data set. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

For this chart, we separated successful, failed, and canceled campaigns for theater “plays” based on a monetary range set based the campaign finance goal.  The monetary ranges narrow down results for a better understanding of the data.  This shows correlation between the campaign funding goal and likelihood of success.  Note that this is represented in percent rather than total number and incorporates all years and all countries within the data set. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The challenges in this data set was determining the best ways to represent meaningful data for Louise.  Understanding the needs of Louise and then looking for correlation between similar Kickstarter campaigns proved difficult given the abundance of data presented in the set.  After determining the type of data being presented by Kickstarter, it was easier to determine that the data Louise would need was within the data set.  Lastly, determining the appropriate visualization that adequately illustrated the relationship of the data most important to Louise and the project.  To solve this challenge, multiple charts were tested before finalizing those used in this report. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1.  Using the “Theater Outcomes by Launch Date” ,  the time of year with the most successful campaigns is between May and July.   Starting a campaign during these 3 months gives the highest probability for success based on these numbers. 
2.  The number of failed campaigns remains mostly constant through the year.  However, the percentage of success increases greatly during late spring/early summer. 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Louise may want to lower the goal amount.  A much higher percentage of campaigns succeeded when the goal was less than $10000.    

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Limitations of this analysis include the dates of the campaigns in the data set being up to 12 years old, locality is broad where donors may be limited to a smaller geographical area.  

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
 
Outcomes based on launch date for Great Britain location

While the Kickstarter platform opens the world to a campaign, people my be less likely to support work in other countries that they may not be able to utilize.  Seeing data for the home country will provide additional insight for when to launch a campaign. 
Average Donation vs Goal for Plays in Great Brittain

Just as the previous table focuses on the home country, this one also limits data to Great Brittain, and those most likely willing to support the campaign.  Having information about the home location for a small scale thearter production provides critical information for Louise.
